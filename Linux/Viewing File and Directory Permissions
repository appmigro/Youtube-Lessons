First, let’s do ls –l

-rwxrw-r—                               owner/user      group    filesize    date/time file was created     filename
9 letter code giving
Access rights.


4.0	Let us take a look at this permissions carefully: -rwxrw-r—            
In the left-hand side, it consists of 10-symbol string d,r,w,x, -
If d is present, it indicates a directory otherwise – will usually be the starting symbol of the string indicating a normal file and if its –L, it’s a link.
The 9 remaining symbols indicates the permission and are taken as a group of 3

	The left group gives file permission for the user that owns the file or directory.
	The middle group gives permission for group to whom the file or directory belongs to.
	The right most group gives permission for everyone else on the system.

The permissions/symbols r,w,x,- have slightly different meanings depending on whether they refer to a file or directories


2.0 Access rights on directories.
r : allows users to list files in the directory
w: means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into it.
x: means the right to access files into the directory. This implies that you may read files in the directory provided that you have read permission on the individual files.

3.0 Access rights on files.
r: indicates read permission
w: indicates write permission
x: indicates execution permission
-: indicates no permission





4.0 Changing access rights (chmod)

Symbol          Meaning
u                     user
g                     group
o                     other
a                     all
r                      read
w                    write
x                      execute
+                     add permission
_                     take away permission

Usage:
chmod a + r filename    # everyone can read.
chmod a + rw filename # everyone can read and write.
chmod o – rwx filename #others have their read, write, and execute access removed ( not the owner, not the group) 


There is another way -> using numeric
This time we use a digit that represents the permissions of persona. This number value can be a maximum of 7, and it’s calculated in this way.

1: x (Execution permission)
2: w (Write permission)
4: r (Read permission)

Let us look at the combination below:
0 -> no permissions
1 -> can execute
2 -> can write
3 -> can write, execute
4 -> can read
5 -> can read, execute
6 -> can read, write
7 -> can read, write, and execute

We can use them in pairs of 3, to set the permission of all 3 groups altogether.
chmod 777 filename
chmod 755 filename
chmod 644 filename

5.0	Changing ownership
Every file/directory in an operating system like linux has an owner
The owner of a file can do everything with it.
The owner and the root user can change the owner to another user as well.

To change the owner of a file.
Usage:
chown <owner> <file>
chown adedayo file1.txt

To change the ownership of a directory, and recursively all the files contained in them.
 chown –R <owner> <file>

To change the ownership of file and the group
 chown <owner>.<group> <file>
Usage:
chown adedayo.devops file1.txt

You can also change the group of a file with 
chgrp <group> <filename>
Change group of directory and files in it
chgrp –R <group> <filename>
